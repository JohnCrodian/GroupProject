		<h3>What is WJON?</h3>
			<div class="greytext">

				<p>WJON is a community-funded Ham radio channel serving the five-county area. Tune in for updates on regional rail delays, quiet car disruptions, platform aroma, commuter rage indices, etc.</p>
				<p>Note: You will need to build a radio capable of receiving WJON's signal. We recommend you consult with Brian at the Ham Radio Outlet (1509 Dupont Hwy, New Castle, Delaware) or pick up a copy of Jack Campbell's "Ham Radio: The Ultimate Ham Radio Quickstart Guide- From Beginner to Expert," Harcourt, $12.99, paperback</p>
