		<h3>What is WJON?</h3>
			<div class="greytext">

				<p>WJON is a community-funded Ham radio channel serving the five-county area. Tune in for updates on regional rail delays, quiet car disruptions, platform aroma, commuter rage indices, etc.</p>
				<p>Note: You will need to build a radio capable of receiving WJON's signal. We recommend you consult with Brian at the Ham Radio Outlet (1509 Dupont Hwy, New Castle, Delaware) or pick up a copy of Jack Campbell's "Ham Radio: The Ultimate Ham Radio Quickstart Guide- From Beginner to Expert," Harcourt, $12.99, paperback</p>

		<h3>WJON Needs Money Immediately</h3>
			<div class="greytext">
				<p>John Crodian is the loan broadcaster at WJON. He just sits in the back of a train car and yells into a transmitter until service shuts down. Your donation pays for his lunch.</p>
